## How It Works  
- The scraper parses the HTML of [hydr0.org](https://hydr0.org/) to identify song information.  
- You select tracks by their index, and the scraper downloads them to the specified directory.  

---

### Upcoming Updates  
- Add a user-friendly interface and deploy it as a web application.  
- Transform it into a feature-rich command-line tool.
